# Crowdsourced Playlist
A mobile application that will allow large groups to coordinate the playlist at the event in which they are participating in real time.

## No longer supported
Because Spotify just came out with their own version of this product and the Spotify Web API was not playing well with my app, I will be moving on from this project.
